# IMPORTANT:

## `jc@coder` has been moved to `pro@coder`

(see [github.com/aipack-ai/packs-pro](https://github.com/aipack-ai/packs-pro))

Do the following:

```sh
aip install pro@coder

# (optional)
aip uninstall jc@coder
```

Then, it works exactly the same:

```sh
aip run pro@coder
```

(Your new prompt file will be at `.aipack/.prompt/pro@coder/coder-prompt.md`)

## Future of `jc@` packs

The `jc@` namespace will be for more personal [AI packs](https://aipack.ai) that are worthwhile to share, perhaps with some experimental or work-in-progress packs.

But all production coding packs will now be under [pro@](https://github.com/aipack-ai/packs-pro).
