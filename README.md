This is JC (Jeremy Chone)'s AI Packs (https://aipack.ai).

They're mostly about coding and can be used as a base for your own AI Packs.

They are licensed under MIT or Apache 2 for maximum flexibility.

These can be a good base for your own pack/agent. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
